# Garnet: SVG Charts in Ruby #

Garnet is a tool for easily transforming data sets into [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) chart images.  The idea is to provide a simple, declarative language for describing the chart and allowing the library to do the heavy lifting.

## Installation and Usage ##

Garnet is installed like any other Ruby gem:

    sudo gem install garnet

## Compatibility ##

Garnet requires Ruby 1.9.x and has been tested on Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.9.3.
